/**
  * Performs single Montecarlo step (MCS) over the cell.
  * A MCS tries to translate and rotate each single particle by
  * a small amount. If no overlapping occurs, the new position and
  * orientation are saved for this particle.
  * The maximum amounts that a particle can translate or rotate are
  * dynamically controlled so as to obtain (in average) the acceptance
  * rate set in "parameters.cpp".
  * Convergence of acceptance rate usually takes some tens of iterations.
