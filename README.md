# AnnularCellSimulation
Simulation of a 2D system of rods inside a vibrating annular cell via a Monte Carlo algorithm.

Rods are represented as rectangles defined by a characteristic WIDTH and LENGTH and their positions are given in cartesian coordinates, plus the angle between their long axis and the OX axis (in radians).
